# Image-Classification
This project uses IBM Cloud to perform image classification with a pre-trained resnet18 model with PyTorch. The data has a total of 40,000 images of concrete with defining classes of "cracked" or "not cracked". The model is evaluated by accuracy and misclassfied samples were accounted for using a confusion matrix.
